Information from the Site.</b>We will not disclose to non-affiliated third parties without your prior approval, your e-mail address, phone number, or other personal information, that we collect via the Site.

 <p><b>3.  Security.  </b>We are committed to ensuring that your personal information is reasonably protected when it is submitted to us and use adequate measures to protect such information collected from our Site.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.  Our Site uses SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption on certain pages where financial transactions may take place to minimize the chances that your personal information can be read as it passes over the Internet.  SSL deters others from seeing your personal information by scrambling it so that only your web browser and our server, can decipher it.  Personal information collected by the Site is stored at a professionally managed secure commercial location.  These measures make it unlikely that your personal information including any credit card information will be compromised online.  However, in the event of an unauthorized use of your credit card, notify your credit card provider or issuing bank in accordance with its reporting rules and procedures.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b.  How do I know my data is safe?  There are two ways to check a website is encrypting your personal and credit card data as it passes over the Internet.  The first is you will notice that the URL address in the address bar of your web browser says
 <a href="https://">https://</a> 
 in the checkout pages, instead of 
 <a href="http://">http://</a> 
 like it normally does.  This "s" signifies that you are passing through a SSL (Secure Socket Layer) to the web server.  Secondly, you should see a small padlock icon in the bottom bar of your web browser.  You can double click on this icon to see additional information about the encryption features.</p>
